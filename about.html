    <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>Hey, thank you for visiting my portfolio! I am Steve, a senior criminal justice major at the University of Rhode Island, and I am interested in joining the FBI. 
        I decided to enroll in CSC106 to learn a bit about programming, because FBI recruiters are looking for people with computer science skills, and because I am a huge video game nerd. 
        When I am not spending time with my wife and son, I am usually playing one of the Total War titles in Steam library, scanning the markets looking for a good crypto currency to invest in or giving my dog some TLC. 
        Besides that though, I was in the Navy for 5 years and have been happily married for the past 8 years. My wife, Shannon and I welcomed our first child into the world last summer, and although the pandemic has
        thrown a wrench in our plans, it has given me a ton of time to spend with him. Although work has been scarce, I would not trade the time I have gained with my son for anything.</p>
