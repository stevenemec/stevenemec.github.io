    <h1> Hey there! Welcome to Steve's Programming Portfolio. </h1>
    <p> I have created this webpage to store and showcase completed projects/assignments for CSC 106.
        I created this site on github.com in HTML, and I will be frequently updating it as my skillset grows.
        'Javascripts' is where I will post completed assignments, and 'About me' is where I will write a bit about myself when the time comes to do so.
        To navigate the webpage, click 'Home' to return to the main index, click 'Javascripts' to view the
        various programs I have written, and click 'About me' if you would like to learn a bit about who I am.</p>
